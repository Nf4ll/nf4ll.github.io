# Challenge: Sanitize

The sanitize challenge is a Web-challenge. It includes the following description:
"Can you escape the query context and log in as admin at my super secure login page?"

## Vulnerability
This vulnerability of this challenge is called SQL injection. SQL injection consists of executing a SQL sentence. With a SQL sentence we can: add, delete, modify or get data from a SQL database. In this case we use an injection to get data from the users table and we could get data from another table like passwords. 

## Explotation
1.  I go to the Web page and I can see a login. I try to basic credentials like admin:admin but I get the select query:

2. At this point I think that the vulnerability in the Web is an SQLi. I try to concat another select with union to get the data from the table users. I inject a payload but It doesn't works.  
```sql
' or 1=1 union select * from users 
```

3. Now I fix the payload by adding ' to close the statement, so I don't get the error:
```sql
' or 1=1 union select * from users '
```
